        <h2 class="header">14th Amendment</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Due Process clause</strong> in the Fourteenth Amendment states that "nor shall any state deprive
            any person or life, liberty, or property without due process of law". This clause was important in this case
            because Cruzan was being required by the state to remain on life support, thus depriving her of her liberty
            without due process of law. <strong>Her vegetative state made her unable to express the will</strong> to die
            or live, making
            the constitutionality of keeping her on life support unclear.</p>

        <p class="quote">
            "The question before this Court is a relatively narrow one: whether the Due Process Clause allows Missouri
            to
            require a now-incompetent patient in an irreversible persistent vegetative state to remain on life support
            absent [without] rigorously clear and convincing evidence that avoiding the treatment represents the
            patient's prior, express choice."

        <p>It is assumed that a competent person has the constitutional right to refuse life support. However, this does
            not mean that an incompetent person also has this right, as they are <strong>unable to make conscious or

        <p>The court ruled that it was <strong>not unconstitutional for Missouri to require "clear and convincing
            evidence"</strong> that an incompetent person wished to be taken off life support.</p>
        <p>An incompetent person is unable to make an "informed and voluntary choice" to exercise the right to
            refuse treatment </p>
        <p>By requiring "clear and convincing evidence", the State of Missouri has established a safeguard to
            prevent
            an incompetent person's surrogate from acting against the incompetent's wishes. By doing this, it is
            acting based on its general interest in the protection and preservation of human life.</p>
        <p><strong>Although Nancy Cruzan's parents were qualified to act as surrogates for her, the evidence they
            provided was not clear enough to override the State's general interest to preserve life</strong></p>
        <p class="quote">"The United States Constitution does not forbid Missouri to require that evidence of an
            incompetent's wishes as to the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment be proved by clear and convincing

        <h2 class="header">Effect on individual rights</h2>
        <p>
            The decision <strong>limited the constitutional rights of both the incompetent and the relatives
            thereof.</strong> It was
            ruled that an incompetent cannot exercise the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment because an
            incompetent cannot make a conscious decision to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, the decision put forward a precedent that no matter how close an individual is to the
            incompetent, it is not unconstitutional for any decisions they make on behalf of the incompetent to be
            scrutinized by the state.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, this decision limited the hypothetical constitutional rights of incompetent individuals, as well
            as the right for surrogates that may make decisions on their behalf.
        </p>
        <img class="picture-half" src="assets/rtd-protest.jpg">

        <h2 class="header">Effect on state rights</h2>
        <p>
            This decision ruled that it was not unconstitutional for Missouri to require evidence before a surrogate
            makes the decision to take an incompetent off life support. It also allowed a state to reject “substituted
            judgement”, where a close family member or parent makes decision for an incompetent. </p>
        <p class="quote">

            family members in the absence of substantial proof that their views reflect the patient's.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, it set forth a precedence on how states could regulate surrogates making decisions on behalf of
            the incompetent. This precedent of increased regulation expanded the power of the state.

    <div class="section">
        <h1 class="header">My Opinion</h1>
        <h2 class="header">I agree with the decision.</h2>
        <p>
            An incompetent person without cognitive function is <strong>unable to make decisions,</strong>
            meaning that the decision to be taken off life support must be made by another person.

        </p>
        <p>
            Considering that <strong>ending one’s life is the largest decision</strong> that could be made on behalf of
            an incompetent
            individual, I believe that whatever decision is made on behalf of the incompetent should be heavily
            scrutinized and that states should be allowed to <strong>ensure the surrogate is acting in the individual’s
            best
            interests.</strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            The best way to infer a now-incompetent individual’s best interest is through evidence from their competent
            past, so I think it is <strong>reasonable for a state to require such evidence.</strong>
