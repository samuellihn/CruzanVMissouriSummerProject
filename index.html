        <h2 class="header">Constitutional Questions: 14th Amendment</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Due Process clause</strong> in the Fourteenth Amendment states that "nor shall any state deprive
            any person or life, liberty, or property without due process of law". This clause was important in this case
            because Cruzan was being required by the state to remain on life support, thus depriving her of her liberty
            without due process of law. <strong>Her vegetative state made her unable to express the will</strong> to die
            or live, making
            the constitutionality of keeping her on life support unclear.</p>


        <p class="quote">
            "The question before this Court is a relatively narrow one: whether the Due Process Clause allows Missouri
            to
            require a now-incompetent patient in an irreversible persistent vegetative state to remain on life support
            absent [without] rigorously clear and convincing evidence that avoiding the treatment represents the
            patient's prior, express choice."
        </p>


        <h3 class="header">The effect of "incompetence"</h3>
        <p>It is assumed that a competent person has the constitutional right to refuse life support. However, this does
            not mean that an incompetent person also has this right, as they are <strong>unable to make conscious or
                informed decisions to withdraw or keep life support.</strong></p>

            <h2 class="header">The Decision</h2>
            <h1 class="header">5-4</h1>
            <h2 class="header" style="font-weight: 400">In favor of the Missouri Department of Health</h2>
            <p>The court ruled that it was <strong>not unconstitutional for Missouri to require "clear and convincing
                evidence"</strong> that an incompetent person wished to be taken off life support.</p>
            <p>An incompetent person is unable to make an "informed and voluntary choice" to exercise the right to
                refuse treatment </p>
            <p>By requiring "clear and convincing evidence", the State of Missouri has established a safeguard to
                prevent
                an incompetent person's surrogate from acting against the incompetent's wishes. By doing this, it is
                acting based on its general interest in the protection and preservation of human life.</p>
            <p><strong>Although Nancy Cruzan's parents were qualified to act as surrogates for her, the evidence they
                provided was not clear enough to override the State's general interest to preserve life</strong></p>
            <p class="quote">"The United States Constitution does not forbid Missouri to require that evidence of an
                incompetent's wishes as to the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment be proved by clear and convincing
                evidence."</p>
            <p class="quote">
                The Due Process Clause does not require a State to accept the "substituted judgment" of close family
                members in the absence of substantial proof that their views reflect the patient's.
